# Hello, I’m Cristian 👋

Senior software engineer building calm, scalable systems.

I design and grow production-grade software — APIs, platforms, and tools — with a focus on clarity, longevity, and real-world impact.

This space is where I:
- Ship ideas as working products  
- Explore architecture, AI, and cloud systems  
- Publish notes, experiments, and technical essays  
- Turn complex problems into simple, reliable solutions  

### What you’ll find here
- Real-world .NET & cloud projects  
- Architectural experiments and reference implementations  
- Tools, templates, and developer utilities  
- Public notes from things I’m actively learning  

I care about:
**clean architecture, thoughtful abstractions, testable code, and systems that age well.**

🌱 Building in public.  
🛠️ Shipping over theorizing.  
📚 Learning continuously.
