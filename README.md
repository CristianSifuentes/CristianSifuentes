💻 Full-stack sorcerer conjuring magic with ⚙️ .NET & 🧪 Microsoft Technologies | 🕸️ Angular artisan by day, dark theme enthusiast by night.
🔧 Git wizard with a love for clean histories, advanced branching, and automation spells. Whether it's a clever rebase or a powerful Git hook, version control is my canvas.
🗃️ Fluent in SQL — from optimizing complex queries to designing normalized (and sometimes denormalized) schemas that scale. Data isn’t just stored; it’s *crafted*.
🧩 Extensions addict. If there's a Visual Studio or VS Code extension that makes dev life smoother, I’ve probably tried it, tweaked it, or written one for fun.
🚀 I build modern, scalable, and beautiful applications — blending backend robustness with frontend finesse. Whether it's crafting APIs with C#, optimizing Azure pipelines, or bringing UI to life with Angular, I’m in my happy place when shipping clean, maintainable code.
🧠 Lifelong learner, obsessed with elegant solutions and geeking out over architecture, design patterns, Git sorcery, and TypeScript tricks. I like my code typed, my tabs spaced, and my commits atomic.
🎯 Currently on a quest to level up in cloud computing, architecture design, and contribute to OSS with my Microsoft-powered toolkit.
