### Hello! 👋

#### I'm a Senior .NET Software Engineer based in Mexico.

##### What I do:

- 💻 Full-stack developer working with .NET technologies and Angular/React. I enjoy building reliable, maintainable applications from backend APIs to polished UIs.
- 🔧 Experienced with Git — from clean commit histories to advanced branching strategies and automation workflows. I take pride in version control done right.
- 🗃️ Proficient in SQL — designing normalized databases, optimizing complex queries, and ensuring scalability.
- 📦 Skilled in Docker containerization for reproducible environments and smooth deployments.
- ☁️ Working with Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines, release management, and automation — helping teams ship with confidence.
- 🧪 Familiar with unit testing libraries including NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest. I believe in testable code, and I write tests that are both meaningful and maintainable.
- 🧠 Strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming, with deep understanding and hands-on experience applying SOLID principles to produce clean, extensible architectures.
- 🧩 Always exploring new tools and extensions — if it improves productivity or dev experience, chances are I’ve tried it (or built it myself).
- 🚀 Passionate about scalable architecture, elegant code, clean patterns, and continuous learning. Whether it’s system design or UI fine-tuning, I’m in my element when solving interesting problems.
